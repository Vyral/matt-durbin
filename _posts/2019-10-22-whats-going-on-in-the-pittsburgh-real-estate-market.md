The third quarter numbers are in for the Pittsburgh real estate market so I wanted to let you know where we’re at now and how that compares to where we were at in the third quarter of 2016 to show how our market has progressed. **We’re going to look at four specific indicators to get the best picture: Properties for sale, median sale price, expired listings, and days on the market.**

In Allegheny, Washington and Westmoreland Counties, we saw a drop in 29% in active inventory from the last three years. In Butler County, we’re down 27% and in Beaver County we’re down 32%. This is all indicative of a seller’s market.

**As for the median sale price, we saw it increase across the board.** It was up 18% in Allegheny County, 17% in Washington County, 12% in Westmoreland County, 11% in Butler County, and 18% in Beaver County.&nbsp;

Expired listings are down by over 20% in Allegheny County, Westmoreland County, Butler County, and Beaver County, but they’re up by 1% in Washington County. **When expired listings drop, we know that the market is strong for sellers.**

For days on market, it’s down anywhere from 18% (in Butler county) all the way up to 32% (in Beaver County.)

As you can see, our seller’s market has only gotten stronger over the last few years with fewer homes for sale, higher sale prices, and lower days on market.&nbsp;

**In addition to these factors, we can also look at our interest rates to get an idea of where the market is heading.** Right now, the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is just 3.65% right now compared to 3.46% at this time in 2016. It’s still a great market to be a buyer in.

Right now, we have just three months of inventory across the market. Butler County has four months, but we’re down by about a third from where it was in 2016. We’re firmly in a seller’s market, and will continue to be until our inventory at least double what it is now.

If you have any questions for us about this current market or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
