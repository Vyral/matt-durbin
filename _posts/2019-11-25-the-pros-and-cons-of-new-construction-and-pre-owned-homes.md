In our luxury market here in Pittsburgh ($600,000 to $1.2 million), there are generally three types of homes: new construction homes, pre-owned homes that were built in the 80s and 90s, and older pre-owned homes that need more than just cosmetic updates. If you’re thinking of buying in the luxury market, today I’ll compare the first two types of homes so you can get a good idea of what’s best for you.&nbsp;

Follow along in the video above to see my full analysis. For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps so you can skip ahead to various sections:&nbsp;
