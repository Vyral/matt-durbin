[Niche.com](https://www.niche.com/) recently made a list of the top 500 school districts in the state of Pennsylvania, and today we’re taking a look at which of the Pittsburgh-area districts made the list.&nbsp;

**To come up with these rankings, Niche.com used a number of different criteria such as test scores, college-readiness, graduation rates, SAT and ACT scores, teacher quality, sports, and more.** You can learn more about their scoring model and see the full list [here.](https://www.niche.com/k12/search/best-school-districts/s/pennsylvania/)&nbsp;
