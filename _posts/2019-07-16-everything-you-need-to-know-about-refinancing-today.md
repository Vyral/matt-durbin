You’ve probably heard a number of agents saying that now is the perfect time to refinance since interest rates are so low. **However, low rates aren’t the only factor to consider if you’re thinking of refinancing.&nbsp;**

For example, most people don’t realize that homeowners almost always have to pay to refinance out of pocket. Otherwise, the cost of refinancing will be rolled into your total loan amount.&nbsp;

So while refinancing with a lower interest rate may reduce the amount you pay in terms of interest and your monthly payment, **you’ll need to pay a significant amount of money to do so.** Ultimately, it’s largely the amount of time it will take before you break even on the cost of refinancing that should help you decide whether to do so at all.&nbsp;

Beyond that, you should also think about how long you plan to be in the home. If you only plan to live in your current home for two or three more years, refinancing is probably a bad idea.&nbsp;

If you know you’ll be in the home for at least seven years, though, you may want to speak to a lender about your options.&nbsp;

Honestly, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer as to whether now is a good time to refinance. If you’d like to find out whether it’s a good idea for you, reach out to us. **We would be happy to connect you with an experienced local lender.**
