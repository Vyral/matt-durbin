Here’s a quick overview of how real estate trends have changed since August of last year for five counties: Allegheny, Washington, Westmoreland, Butler, and Beaver Counties.

**New Listings:**<br>Out of all five counties we’re tracking, only Washington saw an increase in the number of new listings on the market. Year-over-year, 3% more homes came on the Washington County market in August. That’s good because as we all know, there’s a general lack of inventory in our market.

**Pending Sales:**<br>All five counties saw a year-over-year increase in pending sales, demonstrating that demand is still strong. Butler County, in particular, was up by 30% over last year. Washington County only rose by 5% over last year, which is on the flat side in terms of year-to-year increases.

**Median Sales Price:**<br>All five counties except Butler saw an increase in median sales prices. Allegheny County is up by 6%; Washington is up by 23% (a huge increase); Westmoreland rose by 20%; Beaver rose by 3%; and Butler dropped by 9%.

In Butler County specifically, the days on market increased from 53 days last year to 61 days this year, meaning that homes are taking longer to sell. However, pending home sales rose by 30%, which shows strong demand.&nbsp;

In Washington County, because inventory is on the rise, pending sales are on the decline, and median sales prices are way up, **we might begin to see the market level out a bit there.**

In both Butler and Allegheny Counties, expired listing rose over last year. This year, 19% more homes expired in Allegheny County and 30% more expired in Butler County. This might be because of people trying to push their prices a little bit too high. There might also be a little bit of competition with new construction homes, which can cause resale homes to sit on the market a little longer and possibly even fail to sell.

Overall, all five counties saw a decrease in inventory, going from between four or five month’s supply to around three month’s supply. Still, **we’re in a very strong seller’s market.** If you’re thinking of selling your home, take advantage of conditions now before interest rates go up again. They’re fluctuating now, but they’re still under 4%, which is historically very low.
